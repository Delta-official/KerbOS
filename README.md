Hello and welcome to this ReadMe file!

Me and my friend created this bot in order to help KSP players play KSP. Our bot is only 1 month old but it has a lot of great features and has good feedback!

Features include: Links to many useful websites and mods, ∆v map and many more (yes i'm very lazy to list all of them, go check it out yourself since our bot is open source)

Currently the bot is still developing but you can use it!

Below you can see information you may need:

• The bot is fully written in JS and hosted on a private server

• We have a support server if you have any problems or feedback: https://discord.gg/5Q9Mx32

• Just copy this into your browser to invite our bot!: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=718879704601329778&permissions=68673&scope=bot
